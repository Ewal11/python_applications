# Python Application Assessment

Welcome to our Python application assessment repository. This serves as a platform for evaluating the skills of applicants seeking to contribute to our projects.

## Objective 

1. Identify areas of improvement in the code and implement these enhancements.
2. Provide well-written comments that clarify the purpose and functionality of different code sections.

## Guidelines 

Please note the following:

- This repository is strictly for assessment purposes. There's no need for substantial code modifications as the repository is not intended for production.
- Using AI services like ChatGPT for solving these tasks is not allowed, I have already ran the code on chatgdp so I know what type of results to expect. We are interested in your personal coding style, problem-solving skills and ability to improve existing code.
- You're not required to refactor all the code. Spend around 15-20 minutes making the most impactful improvements you can. 

We appreciate your interest and look forward to reviewing your enhancements to the codebase. Best of luck!
